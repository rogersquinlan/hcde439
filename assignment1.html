 <h1>Assignment 1 - BLINK</h1>
 <p>
 Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!
 </p>
Hello, here is my blink project. It took me a bit of time as I am slowly learning this stuff but I got it to work! I use 3 LED's.
 It is a parallel circuit so the voltage is all the same!

<h5>Here is an image of my drawn out schematic. I had a bit of trouble with this as I went right to building my circuit so I tried my best to work backwards.<h5>

 <h5> Here is my arduino code.<h5>
 <xmp>
 void setup() {
 // initialize digital pin 13 as an output.
 pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
 // initialize digital pin 12 as an output.
 pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
 // initialize digital pin 9 as an output.
 pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
 digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // turn 13 LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
 digitalWrite(13, LOW); // turn 13 LED off by making the voltage LOW
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
 digitalWrite(12, HIGH); // turn 12 LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
 digitalWrite(12, LOW); // turn 12 LED off by making the voltage LOW
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
 digitalWrite(9, HIGH); // turn 9 LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
 digitalWrite(9, LOW); // turn 9 LED off by making the voltage LOW
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
}
